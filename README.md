I made a convolutional neural network for classifying this pistachio dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/pistachio-species-classification. The creators of the dataset resorted to transfer learning using such models as AlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19 with the accuracy of 94.42%, 98.84%, and 98.14%, respectively.
I tried to do the classification creating my CNN from scratch. Moreover, I resized the images from 600x600 to 200x200 to speed up the process (I also changed the percentage of the test data from 20 to 10%, though it's hardly relevant). This version of my CNN is the optimal one achieving the accuracy of 93% after 20 epochs (with more epochs, there's no accuracy improvement).
I'm sure if I'd kept the original image size I'd achieved better results, a proof being that when I trained the model (then it was a 3-layer version) with the image size of 350x350, the accuracy was 89% after 10 epochs, whereas with 200x200, it was 84%. Small wonder: higher resolution gives more information, but I deliberately reduced the image size for the sake of speed, as I've mentioned.
